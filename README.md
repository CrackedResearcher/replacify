# replacify

instantly tells you how replaceable you are.

just upload your resume + skills and get brutally honest ai feedback on how soon a machine might take your job.

## what it does

replacify uses llms to analyze your resume and skillset, then predicts how automatable your role is.
it gives you a percentage score and some spicy commentary.
because sometimes, the truth hurts. but at least it's quantified.

## why

because ai is coming for everything — and we thought it’d be fun to tell you if your job is next.

## how it works

- upload resume (pdf or paste text)
- optionally add any extra skills
- we parse it, process it, then ask a few smart models how likely it is you’ll be replaced by ai
- we show you:
  - your ai-replaceability score (0–100%)
  - how confident we are in it
  - some brutally honest commentary
